Report Impression
In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung volumes. Cardiac silhouette is within upper limits of normal in size. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications are again consistent with pulmonary edema. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
In this chest X-ray image, there is no evidence of pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size, and the mediastinal contours are normal. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. The trachea is midline, and the thoracic aorta is mildly tortuous. The upper abdomen is unremarkable.
The lungs are clear bilaterally. Specifically, no evidence of focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.. Cardio mediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Visualized osseous structures of the thorax are without acute abnormality.
