=== OUTPUTS ===
The heart is mildly enlarged. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. The lungs appear clear. The aorta is tortuous. There is
 widening of the right paratracheal stripe, which may be due to vascular
 structures or mediastinal pathology such as a mass or adenopathy.
 Calcifications are noted along each axilla. The bones appear demineralized.

In this chest X-ray image, there is no evidence of pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size, and the mediastinal contours are normal. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. The trachea is midline, and the thoracic aorta is mildly tortuous. The upper abdomen is unremarkable.

The lungs are clear bilaterally. Specifically, no evidence of focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.. Cardio mediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Visualized osseous structures of the thorax are without acute abnormality.

=== FINAL ENSEMBLE REPORT ===
**FINDINGS:**

**LUNGS AND PLEURA:** The lungs are clear bilaterally. There is no evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.

**MEDIASTINUM AND HILA:** The mediastinal contours demonstrate widening of the right paratracheal stripe. This may be related to vascular structures or underlying mediastinal pathology such as adenopathy or a mass. The trachea is midline. The hila are otherwise unremarkable.

**HEART AND VASCULATURE:** The cardiomediastinal silhouette is at the upper limits of normal to mildly enlarged. The thoracic aorta appears mildly tortuous and ectatic, consistent with age-related changes.

**BONES AND SOFT TISSUES:** The visualized osseous structures of the thorax appear generally demineralized. There are no acute fractures or destructive osseous lesions identified. Bilateral axillary calcifications are noted, likely related to benign lymph node calcification or soft tissue changes. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.

**IMPRESSION:**

1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process. The lungs are clear without evidence of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusion.

2.  Mild cardiomegaly.

3.  Widening of the right paratracheal stripe, which is a nonspecific finding. Correlation with prior imaging or further evaluation with CT may be warranted if clinically indicated to exclude mediastinal adenopathy or mass.

4.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.

5.  Diffuse osseous demineralization.

6.  Bilateral axillary calcifications, likely benign.
